The file titled CW is the write up for the Coursework. The file titled lpp.py is the program i used to build the linear programming graphs of each individual edge in the tree. The file titled linear programming problem.ipynb is an anaconda notebook that i used to represent all of the graphs for the edges along with the solutions for the maximization and minimization problems.
